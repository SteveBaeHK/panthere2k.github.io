You can treat that subdomain as if it were an origin target in the Cloudflare dashboard.
Unlike publicly routable IP addresses, the subdomain will only proxy traffic for a DNS record in the same Cloudflare account.</description></item><item><title>Load balancers</title><link>https://panthere2k.github.io/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/routing-to-tunnel/lb/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panthere2k.github.io/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/routing-to-tunnel/lb/</guid><description>Load balancersWhen you create a tunnel, Cloudflare generates a subdomain of cfargotunnel.com with the UUID of the created tunnel. You can treat UUID.cfargotunnel.com as if it were an origin target in the Cloudflare dashboard.
Unlike publicly routable IP addresses, the subdomain will only proxy traffic for a DNS record or a Load Balancer pool in the same Cloudflare account. If someone discovers your subdomain UUID, they will not be able to create a DNS record in another account or system to proxy traffic to the address.</description></item></channel></rss>
