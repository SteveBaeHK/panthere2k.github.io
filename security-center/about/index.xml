These scans perform a series of checks on your Cloudflare account settings and on the configurations of different Cloudflare products for the domains in your Cloudflare account.
The performed checks take into account a set of ideal product configurations and states that indicate a good security posture. If your current configuration does not meet this ideal configuration for one or more checks, the Security Center will report these situations as Security Insights.</description></item></channel></rss>
