If you are familiar with DNS terminology, think of a pool as a “record set,” except Cloudflare only returns addresses that are considered healthy. You can attach health checks to individual pools for customized monitoring.
For more details about how origins and pools become unhealthy, refer to Origin and pool health. &amp;#8203;​ Properties For an up-to-date list of pool properties, refer to Pool properties in our API documentation.</description></item><item><title>Monitors</title><link>https://panthere2k.github.io/load-balancing/understand-basics/monitors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panthere2k.github.io/load-balancing/understand-basics/monitors/</guid><description>MonitorsA monitor issues health checks at regular intervals to evaluate the health of an origin pool. When a pool becomes unhealthy, your load balancer takes that pool out of the server rotation. flowchart LR accTitle: Load balancing monitor flow accDescr: Dynamic load balancing involves pools, origins, monitors, and health checks.

Each load balancer is identified by its DNS hostname (lb.example.com, www.example.com, etc.).

But how does your load balancer know which servers can handle the traffic? We determine that through a system of monitors, health checks, and origin pools.
&amp;#8203;​ Components Dynamic load balancing happens through a combination of origin pools1, monitors2, and health checks3.</description></item><item><title>Proxy status</title><link>https://panthere2k.github.io/load-balancing/understand-basics/proxy-modes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panthere2k.github.io/load-balancing/understand-basics/proxy-modes/</guid><description>Proxy statusYou can load balance your traffic at different levels of the networking stack, including:
Layer 7 or HTTP/HTTPS traffic (most common) DNS-only Layer 4 or TCP traffic &amp;#8203;​ Orange-clouded (layer 7 load balancing) Layer 7 load balancers direct traffic to specific servers based on information present in each HTTP/HTTPS request (HTTP headers, URI, cookies, type of data, etc.).
When a client visits your application, Cloudflare directs their request to a healthy origin server (determined by your traffic steering policy and origin weights).</description></item><item><title>Session affinity</title><link>https://panthere2k.github.io/load-balancing/understand-basics/session-affinity/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panthere2k.github.io/load-balancing/understand-basics/session-affinity/</guid><description>Session affinityWhen you enable session affinity, your load balancer directs all requests from a particular end user to a specific origin server. This continuity preserves information about the user session — such as items in their shopping cart — that might otherwise be lost if requests were spread out among multiple servers.
Session affinity can also help reduce network requests, leading to savings for customers with usage-based billing.
ImportantCloudflare only supports cookie-based session affinity.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive routing</title><link>https://panthere2k.github.io/load-balancing/understand-basics/adaptive-routing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panthere2k.github.io/load-balancing/understand-basics/adaptive-routing/</guid><description>Adaptive routingAdaptive routing controls features that modify the routing of requests to pools and origins in response to dynamic conditions, such as during the interval between active health monitoring requests. If there is another healthy origin in the same pool, the request is retried once against this origin when receiving HTTP 521, 522, and 523 response codes.
&amp;#8203;​ Failover across pools When there are no healthy origin servers in the same pool, failover across pools extend the zero-downtime failover of requests to healthy origin servers in alternate pools according to the failover order defined by traffic and origin steering.</description></item><item><title>Limitations</title><link>https://panthere2k.github.io/load-balancing/understand-basics/limitations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panthere2k.github.io/load-balancing/understand-basics/limitations/</guid><description> Limitations Name Non-Enterprise Enterprise Load balancers 20 100 Monitor intervals 60s (min), 3600s (max) 10s (min), 3600s (max) Monitors 1.5x the number of pools 1.5x the number of pools Origin servers 20 250 Pools 20 100</description></item></channel></rss>
