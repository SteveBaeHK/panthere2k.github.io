If no interval is defined, data will be returned in the default aggregation interval (or frequency). As a general principle, the longer the date range, the bigger the aggregation interval.
For example, when requesting one day of data, the default aggregation interval is 15 minutes. When requesting more than one month of data, the default is one day.</description></item><item><title>Bot classes</title><link>https://panthere2k.github.io/radar/concepts/bot-classes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panthere2k.github.io/radar/concepts/bot-classes/</guid><description> Bot classesA bot class in Radar is a grouping of bot scores.

Confidence levels can be affected either by internal issues affecting data quality or by not having a lot of data for a given location (like Antarctica) or Autonomous System (AS).
Level Description 1 There is not enough data in this time range and/or for this location or Autonomous System. Data also exhibits an erratic pattern, possibly due to the reasons previously mentioned.</description></item><item><title>Normalization methods</title><link>https://panthere2k.github.io/radar/concepts/normalization/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panthere2k.github.io/radar/concepts/normalization/</guid><description>Normalization methodsCloudflare Radar does not normally return raw values.
