Instead of directly connecting their user interface to that database, it is common for developers to use a back-end server to format and proxy API requests to that database. Rather than building a back-end server for this task, you will make use of Cloudflare Workers and an improvement to the PostgreSQL developer experience — PostgREST External link icon Open external link : a REST API built specifically for PostgreSQL.</description></item><item><title>Build Serverless Applications with Cloudflare Pages</title><link>https://panthere2k.github.io/workers/tutorials/build-serverless-application-with-cloudflare-pages/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panthere2k.github.io/workers/tutorials/build-serverless-application-with-cloudflare-pages/</guid><description> Build Serverless Applications with Cloudflare Pages</description></item><item><title>Configure your CDN</title><link>https://panthere2k.github.io/workers/tutorials/configure-your-cdn/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panthere2k.github.io/workers/tutorials/configure-your-cdn/</guid><description>Configure your CDN &amp;#8203;​ Before you start All of the tutorials assume you have already completed the Get started guide, which gets you set up with a Cloudflare Workers account, and the Workers CLI tool, Wrangler External link icon Open external link .

This chat application uses a Durable Object to control each chat room. Users connect to the Object using WebSockets. Messages from one user are broadcast to all the other users. The chat history is also stored in durable storage. Real-time messages are relayed directly from one user to others without going through the storage layer.</description></item><item><title>Generate Youtube thumbnails with Workers and Cloudflare Image Resizing</title><link>https://panthere2k.github.io/workers/tutorials/generate-youtube-thumbnails-with-workers-and-images/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panthere2k.github.io/workers/tutorials/generate-youtube-thumbnails-with-workers-and-images/</guid><description>Generate Youtube thumbnails with Workers and Cloudflare Image Resizing &amp;#8203;​ Before you start All of the tutorials assume you have already completed the Get started guide, which gets you set up with a Cloudflare Workers account, and the Workers CLI tool, Wrangler External link icon Open external link .
