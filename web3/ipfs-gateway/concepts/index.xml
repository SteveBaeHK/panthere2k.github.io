Any computer, anywhere in the world, can download the IPFS software and start hosting and serving files.
If someone runs IPFS on their computer and uploads a file to the IPFS network, that file can be viewed and downloaded by anyone else in the world who is also running IPFS.</description></item><item><title>DNSLink gateways</title><link>https://panthere2k.github.io/web3/ipfs-gateway/concepts/dnslink/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panthere2k.github.io/web3/ipfs-gateway/concepts/dnslink/</guid><description>DNSLink gatewaysWhen you set up a gateway with a DNSLink record, that gateway is restricted to a particular piece of content (either a specific Content Identifier (CID) or an Interplanetary Name Service (IPNS) hostname).
A gateway with a DNSLink - otherwise known as a restricted gateway - differs from a universal gateway, which allows users to access any content hosted on the IPFS network.

When you import anything to the IPFS, that item gets a unique content identifier ( CID External link icon Open external link ) similar to bafybeiaysi4s6lnjev27ln5icwm6tueaw2vdykrtjkwiphwekaywqhcjze.</description></item><item><title>Universal Path gateway</title><link>https://panthere2k.github.io/web3/ipfs-gateway/concepts/universal-gateway/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panthere2k.github.io/web3/ipfs-gateway/concepts/universal-gateway/</guid><description>Universal Path gatewayWhen you set up a Universal Path gateway — a gateway without a DNSLink record — you are creating an unrestricted gateway that allows users to access any content hosted on the IPFS network.
This differs from a restricted gateway, which restricts the gateway to a particular piece of content (either a specific Content Identifier (CID) or an Interplanetary Name Service (IPNS) hostname).
