The image below depicts this sequence, which can be applied for creating and editing rules. The reverse would apply for delete operations.
Cloudflare recommends this sequence because it facilitates filter reusability and allows working with either API independently. Thanks to the standalone nature of Cloudflare Filters, the same filter can be shared in multiple firewall rules and in other future Cloudflare products and features.</description></item></channel></rss>
