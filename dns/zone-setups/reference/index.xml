Setup: You initiated but did not finish the signup process.
Pending Nameserver Update:
Causes:
Full setups: You have either not changed your authoritative nameservers at your registrar or your change has not yet been authenticated. Partial setups: You have either not added the verification TXT record to your authoritative DNS or that record has not yet been authenticated.</description></item><item><title>Nameserver assignment</title><link>https://panthere2k.github.io/dns/zone-setups/reference/nameserver-assignment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panthere2k.github.io/dns/zone-setups/reference/nameserver-assignment/</guid><description>Nameserver assignmentWhen you activate a domain on a full setup, Cloudflare automatically assigns your nameservers. Each domain&amp;rsquo;s assigned nameservers may be different than other domains, even if those domains are within the same account.
These nameserver assignments cannot be changed unless you set up custom or vanity nameservers.
