&amp;#8203;​ Limitations &amp;#8203;​ DNS-only CNAME at zone apex If you are using Cloudflare as your primary DNS provider, we allow you to set a CNAME record on the zone apex because we do CNAME Flattening.
If you take advantage of this behavior within Cloudflare (using an unproxied CNAME record on your zone apex) while using outgoing zone transfers for this zone, Cloudflare will not transfer out the target hostname of the CNAME record but instead the flattened IP address(es) that also get served as DNS responses from Cloudflare authoritative nameservers.</description></item></channel></rss>
