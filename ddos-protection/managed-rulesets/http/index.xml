Configure all the rules in the ruleset Configure one or more rules Tag and rule configurations have greater priority than ruleset configurations.
For more information on the available parameters and allowed values, refer to Managed ruleset parameters.
Important note for API usersThe API allows you to specify a custom rule expression so that a configuration (or override) only applies to a subset of incoming requests.</description></item><item><title>Configure via API</title><link>https://panthere2k.github.io/ddos-protection/managed-rulesets/http/configure-api/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panthere2k.github.io/ddos-protection/managed-rulesets/http/configure-api/</guid><description>Configure HTTP DDoS Attack Protection via APIConfigure the HTTP DDoS Attack Protection managed ruleset by defining overrides using the Rulesets API.
Each zone has the HTTP DDoS Attack Protection managed ruleset enabled by default. This means that you do not need to deploy the managed ruleset to the ddos_l7 phase ruleset explicitly. You only have to create a rule in the phase ruleset to deploy the managed ruleset if you need to configure overrides.</description></item><item><title>Rule categories</title><link>https://panthere2k.github.io/ddos-protection/managed-rulesets/http/rule-categories/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panthere2k.github.io/ddos-protection/managed-rulesets/http/rule-categories/</guid><description>Rule categoriesRules in the HTTP DDoS Attack Protection managed ruleset belong to the following categories (also known as tags):
