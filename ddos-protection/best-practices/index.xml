Cloudflare recommends that you do not use a third-party CDN in front of Cloudflare. Some CDN providers may introduce subtleties into HTTP requests that deviate from protocol standards and/or protocol best practices. Additionally, because traffic to Cloudflare will originate from a limited set of IP addresses of the third-party CDN, in rare occasions — such as when using the Akamai CDN in front of Cloudflare — it may appear as if the CDN is launching a DDoS attack against Cloudflare due to the amount of traffic from these limited IP addresses.</description></item></channel></rss>
