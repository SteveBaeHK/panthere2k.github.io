Read the SXGs caveats to check requirements regarding request and response headers. SXGs are available for zones with a Pro or higher plan. SXGs are also available for zones on a Free plan with an APO subscription. SXGs only work with zones that have their nameservers managed by Cloudflare. Refer to Change your authoritative nameservers to learn how to change your domain nameservers to Cloudflare.</description></item><item><title>SXGs caveats</title><link>https://panthere2k.github.io/fundamentals/signed-exchanges/signed-exchanges/signed-exchanges-caveats/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panthere2k.github.io/fundamentals/signed-exchanges/signed-exchanges/signed-exchanges-caveats/</guid><description>Signed exchanges caveats &amp;#8203;​ Allowed request headers Signed exchanges remove cookies and headers from HTTP requests, which can create problems with dynamic or personalized content. This is intentional since signed exchanges can be distributed to multiple browsers. Therefore, packaging any personalized or dynamic content into a signed exchange could be a security risk. The only request headers that are not removed are the following:
AMP-Cache-Transform Accept From User-Agent Accept Via CF-Connecting-IP True-Client-IP X-Forwarded-For CF-RAY CF-IPCountry CF-Visitor CF-Loop CF-Worker CF-Threat-Score X-Bot-Score X-Static-Bot X-Threat-Score X-Tlsclientauth X-Verified-Bot &amp;#8203;​ Response headers Since Cloudflare cannot be sure whether a signed exchange includes private information or not, a signed exchange will not be generated in the presence of the following response headers External link icon Open external link :</description></item><item><title>Reference</title><link>https://panthere2k.github.io/fundamentals/signed-exchanges/signed-exchanges/reference/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panthere2k.github.io/fundamentals/signed-exchanges/signed-exchanges/reference/</guid><description>Reference &amp;#8203;​ Verify that signed exchanges are working Make a request with the the signed exchange request header:
