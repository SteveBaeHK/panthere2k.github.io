The primary certificate uses a P-256 key, is SHA-2/ECDSA signed, and will be presented to browsers that support elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). The secondary or fallback certificate uses an RSA 2048-bit key, is SHA-2/RSA signed, and will be presented to browsers that do not support ECC.</description></item><item><title>Renew</title><link>https://panthere2k.github.io/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/issue-and-validate/renew-certificates/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panthere2k.github.io/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/issue-and-validate/renew-certificates/</guid><description>Renew certificatesThe exact method for certificate renewal depends on whether that hostname is proxying traffic through Cloudflare and whether it is a wildcard certificate.
Custom hostnames with DigiCert certificates currently have a validity period of one year, though DigiCert is going to be deprecated soon as an option. Custom hostnames using Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt or Google Trust Services have a 90 day validity period.
Certificates are available for renewal 30 days before their expiration.</description></item></channel></rss>
