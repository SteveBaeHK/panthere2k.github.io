Work with your account team to understand everything you need to ensure a smooth transition.
&amp;#8203;â€‹ Overview Cloudflare requires a service-specific configuration for your prefixes, as well as some requirements common to all BYOIP customers regardless of service type. These requirements are common to all products compatible with BYOIP, such as Magic Transit, CDN, and Spectrum.</description></item><item><title>Cloudflare IPs</title><link>https://panthere2k.github.io/byoip/cloudflare-ips/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panthere2k.github.io/byoip/cloudflare-ips/</guid><description>Cloudflare IPsIf you are unable to bring your own IP to Cloudflare, you can use an IP address issued by Cloudflare.
Using a Cloudflare IP may be a good option if you:
Have one or a few IPs allocated from home or business class ISPs. Are an online streamer who could be the target of a DoS attack if your IP is leaked. Are a business owner with a small number of locations with broadband Internet connections.</description></item><item><title>Proxy IPs</title><link>https://panthere2k.github.io/byoip/proxy-ips/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panthere2k.github.io/byoip/proxy-ips/</guid><description>Proxy IPsThe Address Map is a data structure enabling customers with BYOIP prefixes or account-level Static IPs to specify which IP addresses should be mapped to a zone&amp;rsquo;s DNS records when they are proxied through Cloudflare.
For an Address Map to take effect, DNS records within the mapped zone must be set to proxied or orange-clouded. When a zone is proxied, Cloudflare authoritative DNS will respond with the address(es) on the Address Map.</description></item></channel></rss>
