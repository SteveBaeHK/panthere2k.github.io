Use Cloudflare Firewall Rules if you do not have access to WAF custom rules. Even though firewall rules are not based on the Ruleset Engine, you can use the same Rules language to define firewall rule expressions.
For more information on firewall rules, refer to Cloudflare Firewall Rules.</description></item><item><title>Security Analytics</title><link>https://panthere2k.github.io/waf/security-analytics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panthere2k.github.io/waf/security-analytics/</guid><description>Security Analytics Beta The Security Analytics dashboard displays information about all incoming HTTP requests for your domain, including requests not handled by Cloudflare security products.
Gradually available to Enterprise customers on Core and Advanced bundles. In the dashboard you can visualize which traffic is being mitigated by Cloudflare, review several security-related statistics about incoming requests (such as bot score, attack scores, and uploaded content scanning results), and check which requests are reaching the origin server or being handled directly by Cloudflare.</description></item></channel></rss>
