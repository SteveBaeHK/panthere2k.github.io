Configuration Rules can also be used to block Zaraz from loading based on cookies, IP addresses or anything else related to a request.
Refer to Configuration Rules documentation to learn more about this feature and how you can use it with Zaraz.
If you need to block one or more actions from firing in a tool, Cloudflare recommends you use Blocking Triggers instead of Configuration Rules.</description></item><item><title>Blocking Triggers</title><link>https://panthere2k.github.io/zaraz/advanced/blocking-triggers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panthere2k.github.io/zaraz/advanced/blocking-triggers/</guid><description>Blocking TriggersBlocking Triggers are triggers that instead of being used to define when to start an action, are used to define when to not start an action. You may need to block one or more actions in a tool from firing when a specific condition arises. For these cases, you can set Blocking Triggers.
Every tool action has Firing Triggers assigned to it. Blocking Triggers are optional and, if defined, will conditionally prevent the action from starting.</description></item><item><title>Data layer compatibility mode</title><link>https://panthere2k.github.io/zaraz/advanced/datalayer-compatibility/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panthere2k.github.io/zaraz/advanced/datalayer-compatibility/</guid><description>Data layer compatibility modeCloudflare Zaraz offers backwards compatibility with the dataLayer function found in tag management software, used to track events and other parameters. This way you can keep your current implementation and Cloudflare Zaraz will automatically collect your events.
To keep the Zaraz script as small and fast as possible, the data layer compatibility mode is disabled by default. To enable it:
Go to Zaraz External link icon Open external link &amp;gt; Settings.</description></item><item><title>Domains not proxied by Cloudflare</title><link>https://panthere2k.github.io/zaraz/advanced/domains-not-proxied/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panthere2k.github.io/zaraz/advanced/domains-not-proxied/</guid><description>Use Zaraz on domains not proxied by CloudflareYou can load Zaraz on domains that are not proxied through Cloudflare. However, you will need to create a separate domain, or subdomain, proxied by Cloudflare (also known as orange-clouded External link icon Open external link domains), and load the script from it:
Create a new subdomain like my-subdomain.example.com and proxy it through Cloudflare. Refer to Enabling the Orange Cloud External link icon Open external link for more information.</description></item><item><title>Load Zaraz manually</title><link>https://panthere2k.github.io/zaraz/advanced/load-zaraz-manually/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panthere2k.github.io/zaraz/advanced/load-zaraz-manually/</guid><description>Load Zaraz manuallyBy default, if your domain is proxied by Cloudflare, Zaraz will automatically inject itself to HTML pages in your site. This makes it easier to get up and running quickly. However, you might want to load Zaraz manually, for example to test Zaraz on specific pages first.
After you turn off the Auto-inject script option, you will have to manually include the Zaraz script in your HTML, immediately before the &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt; tag closes.</description></item></channel></rss>
