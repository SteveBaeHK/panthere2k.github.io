When you override a ruleset you specify changes to be executed on top of the default configuration. These changes take precedence over the ruleset&amp;rsquo;s default behavior.
For example, to test a managed ruleset before enforcing it, consider executing the ruleset with all rules set to log instead of their default actions. To do this, override the configured behavior of the managed ruleset at the ruleset level, so that each rule uses the log action.</description></item></channel></rss>
