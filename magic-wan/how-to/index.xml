Cloudflare will assign two Cloudflare endpoint addresses shortly after your onboarding kickoff call that you can use as the tunnel destinations on your data center routers/endpoints.
To configure the tunnels between Cloudflare and your locations, you must provide the following data for each tunnel:
Customer edge IP address — A public Internet routable IP address that is outside of the prefixes Cloudflare will advertise on your behalf.</description></item><item><title>Configure static routes</title><link>https://panthere2k.github.io/magic-wan/how-to/configure-static-routes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panthere2k.github.io/magic-wan/how-to/configure-static-routes/</guid><description>Configure static routesMagic WAN uses a static configuration to route your traffic through Anycast tunnels from Cloudflare’s edge to your locations.
You must assign a route priority to each tunnel–subnet pair in your configuration, as follows:
Lower values have greater priority. When the priority values for prefix entries match — as illustrated by the 10.10.10.102/31 subnet in the example routing configuration (in bold) — Cloudflare uses equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) packet forwarding to route traffic.</description></item><item><title>Run endpoint health checks</title><link>https://panthere2k.github.io/magic-wan/how-to/run-endpoint-health-checks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panthere2k.github.io/magic-wan/how-to/run-endpoint-health-checks/</guid><description>Run endpoint health checksMagic WAN uses endpoint health checks to determine the overall health of your inter-network connections. Probes originate from Cloudflare infrastructure (outside customer network namespaces) and target IP addresses deep within your network. This process occurs beyond the tunnel-terminating border router, and these “long distance” probes are purely diagnostic.
When choosing which endpoint IP addresses to monitor with health checks, use these guidelines:
Provide one IP address for each of the prefixes Cloudflare will advertise.</description></item><item><title>View Network Analytics</title><link>https://panthere2k.github.io/magic-wan/how-to/view-analytics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panthere2k.github.io/magic-wan/how-to/view-analytics/</guid><description>View Network AnalyticsCloudflare’s Network Analytics provides near real-time visibility into network and transport layer traffic patterns and DDoS attacks which can help troubleshoot IP traffic issues. You can also use Network Analytics to view information about the traffic that leaves Cloudflare&amp;rsquo;s Edge by reviewing ingress and egress tunnel traffic over a specific amount of time.

For example, if you have multiple Cloudflare products managed by different teams on the same account, you may want to provide select users with edit access and other users with read-only access.

With an IPsec tunnel, you can route traffic from your network to Cloudflare&amp;rsquo;s edge and define static routes to direct traffic down the correct tunnel. To learn more about Anycast IPsec, refer to What is IPsec? External link icon Open external link .
Before you begin, make sure you already have an Account ID and API Key.</description></item></channel></rss>
