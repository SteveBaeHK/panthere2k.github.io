To monitor the health of a specific route, each Cloudflare edge server associated with your network sends a multicast &amp;ldquo;heartbeat&amp;rdquo; every few seconds to construct a list of live, peer IP addresses. This approach utilizes consistent hashing, and as a result, Magic Transit and Magic WAN can consistently assign tunnels to servers in a way that is resilient to server failures and does not require extra coordination between servers beyond heartbeats.</description></item><item><title>Traffic steering</title><link>https://panthere2k.github.io/magic-wan/about/traffic-steering/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panthere2k.github.io/magic-wan/about/traffic-steering/</guid><description>Traffic steeringMagic WAN uses a static configuration to route traffic through Anycast tunnels from Cloudflare’s edge to your network and from your network to Cloudflare&amp;rsquo;s edge.
Magic WAN steers traffic along tunnel routes based on priorities you define during the onboarding process.
To enable TCP download optimization for eligible traffic, contact your account team. The example in this diagram has three tunnel routes. Tunnels 1 and 2 have top priority and Tunnel 3 is secondary.</description></item><item><title>Tunnels &amp; encapsulation</title><link>https://panthere2k.github.io/magic-wan/about/tunnels-and-encapsulation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://panthere2k.github.io/magic-wan/about/tunnels-and-encapsulation/</guid><description>Tunnels &amp;amp; encapsulationMagic WAN uses Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) External link icon Open external link and IPsec External link icon Open external link tunnels to transmit packets from Cloudflare’s edge to your origin network. Cloudflare sets up tunnel endpoints on edge servers inside your network namespace, and you set up tunnel endpoints on routers at your data center.
